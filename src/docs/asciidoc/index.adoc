. Been programming with Java, Groovy, Objective-C
. lgtm.in, ihe-iti, swaggydoc
. Web developers vs Android/iOS/griffon developers?
. Groovy experience vs java developers?
. How far into the future/past is iOS for you?
. Who has written Functional tests?
. Whose employer's primary business is developing software?

== Where I work

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Transcend insights
* Used by 130 Health Systems, 600 Hospitals, 20K physicians
* We love groovy

This is all the technologies we've had over the years

== Why iOS?

And why at a _this_ conference?

== What does it take to build an iOS app?

[NOTE.speaker]
--
So you just heard that you (or your team) will be doing iOS work.
Also let's assume that you want to build a native iOS app.
Not sencha, phonegap, appcelerator, robovm, ionic.
--

== XCode or AppCode

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* This is often a question of personal preference.
* XCode is just an editor fitted with some autocomplete and a compiler.
* AppCode is everything IntelliJ IDEA does (for Objective-C)
* AppCode support for UI is still not as good as XCode.
--

== Swift vs Objective-C

[%step]
* Tooling
* Libraries

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* This is a question of team choices. But you have choices.
* OCLint is very mature. SwiftLint is rather new.
* AppCode support for Swift is very basic.
* A majority of pods out there are still Objective-C and some
  just cannot support Swift.
--

== Dependency management

[%step]
* Libraries vs frameworks

=== &nbsp;
_And I don't mean transitive dependencies..._

=== Dependencies

[%step]
* Your app needs dependencies
* Dependencies can be installed with Cocoapods
* Cocoapods is a ruby gem
* Ruby gems can be installed with Bundler
* You WANT ruby in the user space; so RBENV
* There is a brew formula for RBENV
* brew is installed using system ruby

== Build Tools

Not 10 bullet points telling you to point and click at things.

=== XcodeBuild

[%step]
* Too complex commands - Unruly bash scripts
* Different tools for build, upload to testflight, hockeyapp
* Very little documentation, very steep learning curve
* What about functional testing?

=== xctool

xctool \
    -workspace Todos.xcworkspace \
    -sdk iphonesimulator \
    -scheme Todos \
    test

=== xctool

[%step]
* Written in Objective-C
* Needs advanced knowledge of Objective-C
* What about functional testing?

=== Gradle Xcode Plugin

[source,gradle]
----
buildscript {
  repositories {
    maven { url "https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/" }
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath "gradle.plugin.org.openbakery:xcodePlugin:0.11.3"
  }
}
apply plugin: "org.openbakery.xcodeplugin"
xcodebuild {
  workspace = 'Todos.xcworkspace'
  scheme = 'Todos'
  target = 'Todos'
  sdk = 'iphonesimulator'
}

=== Gradle Xcode Plugin

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew xcodetest
./gradlew appstoreUpload

== Functional Testing

=== UIAutomation using Instruments

* Record and Playback
* DOM Tree access
* Refactoring
* Managing State
* Tuneup JS? Bwoken?

=== Appium

* Based on Selenium
* Clients for several languages including Java
* Makes your app stateless

=== Groovy + Spock

* Spock's expressive testing
* Groovy's metaprogramming to improve access to DOM

== Continuous Integration

=== Jenkins

=== Immutable slaves

=== Travis CI
