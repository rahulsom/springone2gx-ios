== About me
[NOTE.speaker]
--
. Been programming with Java, Groovy, Objective-C
. lgtm.in, ihe-iti, swaggydoc
. Web developers vs Android/iOS/griffon developers?
. Groovy experience vs java developers?
. How far into the future/past is iOS for you?
. Who has written Functional tests?
. Whose employer's primary business is developing software?

== Where I work

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Transcend insights
* Used by 130 Health Systems, 600 Hospitals, 20K physicians
* We love groovy

This is all the technologies we've had over the years

== Why iOS?

And why at a _this_ conference?

== What does it take to build an iOS app?

[NOTE.speaker]
--
So you just heard that you (or your team) will be doing iOS work.
Also let's assume that you want to build a native iOS app.
Not sencha, phonegap, appcelerator, robovm, ionic.
--

== XCode or AppCode

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* This is often a question of personal preference.
* XCode is just an editor fitted with some autocomplete and a compiler.
* AppCode is everything IntelliJ IDEA does (for Objective-C)
* AppCode support for UI is still not as good as XCode.
--

== Swift vs Objective-C

[%step]
* Tooling
* Libraries

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* This is a question of team choices. But you have choices.
* OCLint is very mature. SwiftLint is rather new.
* AppCode support for Swift is very basic.
* A majority of pods out there are still Objective-C and some
  just cannot support Swift.
--

== Dependency management

[%step]
* Libraries vs frameworks

[data-background="images/matryoshka.jpg"]
=== &nbsp;

=== &nbsp;
_And I don't mean transitive dependencies..._

=== Dependencies

[%step]
* Your app needs dependencies
* Dependencies can be installed with Cocoapods
* Cocoapods is a ruby gem
* Ruby gems can be installed with Bundler
* You WANT ruby in the user space; so RBENV
* There is a brew formula for RBENV
* brew is installed using system ruby

== Build Tools

Not 10 bullet points telling you to point and click at things.

=== XcodeBuild

[source,bash]
----
xcodebuild \
    -scheme Todos \
    -workspace Todos.xcworkspace \
    -sdk iphonesimulator \
    -configuration Debug \
    DSTROOT=/Users/rahul/src/Todos/build/dst \
    OBJROOT=/Users/rahul/src/Todos/build/obj \
    SYMROOT=/Users/rahul/src/Todos/build/sym \
    SHARED_PRECOMPS_DIR=/Users/rahul/src/Todos/build/shared \
    -destination \
    'platform=iOS Simulator,id=CAB835ED-3EE2-47B6-AD74-C06675651CEF' \
    test
----

=== XcodeBuild

[%step]
* Too complex commands - Unruly bash scripts
* Different tools for build, upload to testflight, hockeyapp
* Very little documentation, very steep learning curve
* What about functional testing?

=== xctool

[source,bash]
----
xctool \
    -workspace Todos.xcworkspace \
    -sdk iphonesimulator \
    -scheme Todos \
    test
----

=== xctool

[%step]
* Written in Objective-C
* Needs advanced knowledge of Objective-C
* What about functional testing?

[NOTE.speaker]

* Written by facebook

=== Nomad CLI

[source,bash]
----
ios profiles:list --team=ABCDE56789
ipa build && ipa distribute
----

=== Nomad CLI

[%step]
* Written in ruby
* Great support for certificates, distribution profiles
* Great support for distribution using iTunesConnect
* What about testing?

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Written by nshipster guy
* CUPERTINO - manage apple dev center
* HOUSTON - Notifications
* DUBAI - Passbook
* VENICE - App Store purchase management
* SHENZEN - build and distribution
--

=== What we need

[%step]
* Flexible build system
* Support for distribution
* Support for functional testing
* Easy to install, even if you're an enterprise software company
* Easy to run

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Time to Yosemite
--

=== Gradle Xcode Plugin

[source,gradle]
----
buildscript {
  repositories {
    maven { url "https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/" }
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath "gradle.plugin.org.openbakery:xcodePlugin:0.11.3"
  }
}
apply plugin: "org.openbakery.xcodeplugin"
xcodebuild {
  workspace = 'Todos.xcworkspace'
  scheme = 'Todos'
  target = 'Todos'
  sdk = 'iphonesimulator'
}
----

=== Gradle Xcode Plugin

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew xcodetest
./gradlew appstoreUpload
----

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Comparison with js being wrapped by gradle
* Comparison with CSS
* Value of submodules
--

== Functional Testing

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* For software that runs on the edge, that's the best way to check if value is delivered.
* Too many people don't believe in testing because its too hard.
--

=== UIAutomation using Instruments

* Record and Playback
* DOM Tree access
* Refactoring
* Managing State
* Tuneup JS? Bwoken?

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Record and Playback - bad
--

=== Appium

* Based on Selenium
* Clients for several languages including Java
* Makes your app stateless

=== Groovy + Spock

* Spock's expressive testing
* Groovy's metaprogramming to improve access to DOM

== Continuous Integration

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Because developers are too lazy to run tests
--

=== Jenkins

* Cloudbees runs a very old version of OSX and XCode.
* Bring your own Jenkins and/or Bring your own slaves.

[NOTE.speaker]
--
* Why is this hard
--


=== Immutable slaves

* There's no Docker for OSX
* But there is vagrant. [fragment]Kind of
* You're better off managing slaves as `mutable` instances

=== Travis CI

* Recently added GA support for XCode
* Can't run appium yet.
